Archaeologist Assistant: AI-Powered Archaeological Discovery System

The Archaeologist Assistant is an AI system designed to replicate the reasoning process of a field archaeologist using OpenAI’s GPT-4o-mini model. Developed with AI Engine Pro and real-time WebSearch integration, it analyzes publicly available satellite imagery, LIDAR databases, and historical records to identify potential archaeological sites in the Amazon basin.

In one use case, the assistant was prompted to locate the legendary "City of Z" and proposed a plausible site near the Mapinguari River (Latitude -7.5, Longitude -63.5). This recommendation was based on findings from LIDAR topography, references to Fawcett’s expeditions, and indigenous narratives, fulfilling multiple sourcing criteria.

All data sources used are open-access, and the workflow is reproducible. The project showcases how AI can be directed to produce specific, research-driven hypotheses based on multi-domain evidence, and supports the idea that digital tools can assist human researchers in proposing credible archaeological targets.
